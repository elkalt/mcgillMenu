# *Cafe Critics*

*Made for McHacks 10*

## **Inspiration**

As three first-year students, we find ourselves eating at McGill's dining halls frequently and sometimes the experience can be... _surprising_. We wanted to create a website for other students who frequent the dining halls to be able to not only see the weekly menu at each of McGill's 5 dining hall locations, but also see _cumulative_ ratings of the meals compiled from other student input over time.

We created a full-stack application that calls an API to reference the data we organized in the backend to be used in the front end. First, we pursed the weekly menu PDFs for the dining halls to create our data base. Then, we used APIs to integrate ratings into the dishes in the menu. And finally, we created a website to display the information.

## **Our Website**

The _Campus Critics_ is available here:

Our menu has three pages. The _Menu_ page is for viewing the weekly menu at each of McGill's 5 dining hall locations. The _Dishes_ page shows all dishes available at all of the dining halls for a given week and allows users to search by rating, name and dietary allowances. And the _About_ page that links to each of the creators on this project.

The most helpful tools used when developing this website were magic, witchcraft, and alchemy. Banging heads on keyboards was also useful.

## **Things Learned & Challenges Faced**

Over the course of this project, we learned a lot both about PDF parsing and web-development, and also about how to have multiple people collaborating on one project. We found a good balance between splitting up work and working together that will be very valuable when collaborating with others in the future.

We found some obstacles in PDF pursing and analyzing the data from it as the PDFs often read inconsistently. Most of our obstacles were in web-development; there were many tedious errors and alterations that we had to fix and adjust when refining the website.

## **Possible Improvements**

There is so much to expand upon with _Cafe Critics_!! We can breakdown the ratings to certain specific qualities or even allow for user input to account for unexpected dishes that may show up at the dining halls.

We hope to see you next year at McHacks 11!!
